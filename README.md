The purpose of this project was to incorporate multiple charts/graphs into an interactive dashboard to allow users to exam the data from a belly button biodiversity study.  The page loads charts/graphs with information from the first sample id and then the user can select
another sample id.  The page will reload with updated data from the chosen sample in the charts/graphs. 

The project contents are the following:
(1.) The Static/js folder with the js application. The CSS was not updated for this project.
(2.) The index html file, no updates were needed for this project. 
(3.) The data source is the samples.json file.

The Belly Button Washing gauge chart was included in this project.
